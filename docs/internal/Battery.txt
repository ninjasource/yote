From nPM1100 Product Specification:
3.7 Battery considerations
The charger can only be used with Li-ion/Li-poly rechargeable batteries.
Battery packs connected to the VBAT pin must contain the following protection circuitry:
• Overcharge protection
• Undervoltage protection
• Overcurrent discharge fuse
• Thermal fuse to protect from overtemperature (if NTC thermistor is not present)
